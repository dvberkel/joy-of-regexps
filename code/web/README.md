Joy of Regexp Code Web
======================

This directory contains the web code primarly used during the
presentation.

Development
-----------

We use [npm][] to manage our dependency. Execute the following command
to install them

    npm install

[grunt][] is used to automate various tasks. The executable is
installed at `./node_modules/.bin/grunt`. The following command
creates an alias so grunt can be called without a hassle

    alias grunt=./node_modules/.bin/grunt

To make a distribution of this code run the next command

    grunt

The test suite relies on [phantomjs][]. The tests are written as
[jasmine][] specs. The following command executes all the tests.

    grunt jasmine

You can view the result in a real browser by opening
`_SpecRunner.html` which is generated by this `grunt jasmine`
task. Change the template `spec/template/_SpecRunner.tmpl` when
necessary.
