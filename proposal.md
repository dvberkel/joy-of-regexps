Abstract
--------

Regular expressions are powerfull but hard to read. We provide an
alternative means of expressing regular language that is better
amendable to manipulation and understanding. Furthermore participants
are challenged to use the new found insight to solve tough problems in
a provided regular expression playground.

Summary
-------

[Regular expressions][regexps] are a powerfull tool in a developers
toolbox. Their concise structure allow for great expressive power with
compact notation. This character of a regular expression is a
double-edged sword. Often regular expressions are perceived as a
write-only language.

In this talks we will bring back the joy in dealing with regular
expression. We will bridge the gap from feared tool to trusted
companion by leveraging the dual nature regular expression: *finite
state machine*.
We will build a powerfull visual means of describing regular
expressions. Various operation on regular expression like
*composition* and *alternation* have a clear and easy to understand
parallel.

By providing an alternate but equivalent means of expressing regular
language we gain greater comprehension and easy manipulation. We will
excercise our new found insight by solving though problems with
easy. During the talk a playground is introduced which allows
developers to experience the joy of their newly acquired skill.

Target
------

Developers with a interesting in improving their regular expression skills.
